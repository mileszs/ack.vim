INTRODUCTION                                                             *ack*

This plugin is a front for the Perl module App::Ack.  Ack can be used as a
replacement for grep.  This plugin will allow you to run ack from vim, and
shows the results in a split window.

:Ack[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                               *:Ack*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given the first
    error is jumped to.

:AckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                            *:AckAdd*

    Just like |:Ack|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
    appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:AckFromSearch [{directory}]                                  *:AckFromSearch*

    Just like |:Ack| but the pattern is from previous search.

:LAck [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                *:LAck*

    Just like |:Ack| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed in
    the current |location-list|.

:LAckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:LAckAdd*

    Just like |:AckAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are added
    to the current |location-list|

:AckFile [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:AckFile*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for filenames matching the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the
    |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

:AckOption[!] [{option-list}]

    Add or remove options to the ack command line. This is a simple interface
    to editing |g:ackprg|. Called with a bang, the given options are removed.

    Note that the options don't start with a "--".

    Example usage (called successively): >

      AckOption yaml
<       Ack called as: ack -H --nocolor --nogroup --column --yaml >
      AckOption noyaml xml
<       Ack called as: ack -H --nocolor --nogroup --column --noyaml --xml >
      AckOption! yaml
<       Ack called as: ack -H --nocolor --nogroup --column --xml

    It can be called with multiple options and it will simply apply them one
    by one. It can be called with no options at all in order to display the
    value of the current |g:ackprg|.

:AckIgnore[!] [{ignore-dirs}]

    Add or remove ignore-dirs to the ack command line. Like |AckOption|, it's
    just a simple interface to editing |g:ackprg|. With a bang, the ignore-dirs
    are removed.

    On the command-line, it completes with files in the current directory.

    Note that it currently doesn't normalize directory names, so "coverage/"
    and "coverage" are added to the ignore-list separately.

    Example usage (called successively): >

      AckIgnore app/models/
<       Ack called as: ack -H --nocolor --nogroup --column --ignore-dir='app/models/' >
      AckIgnore! app/models/
<       Ack called as: ack -H --nocolor --nogroup --column

    It can be called with multiple directories and it will add them one by
    one. It can be called with no options at all in order to display the value
    of the current |g:ackprg|.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

MAPPINGS                                                        *ack-mappings*

The following keyboard shortcuts are available in the quickfix window:

o                   open file (same as enter).

go                  preview file (open but maintain focus on ack.vim results).

t                   open in a new tab.

T                   open in new tab silently.

v                   open in vertical split.

gv                  open in vertical split silently.

q                   close the quickfix window.
